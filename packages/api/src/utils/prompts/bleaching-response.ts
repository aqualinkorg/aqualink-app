## CORAL BLEACHING EMERGENCY RESPONSE

### UNDERSTANDING CORAL BLEACHING

**What is it?**
Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) due to stress, primarily from elevated water temperatures. Corals turn white and, if prolonged, can die.

**Key indicators on Aqualink**:
- **DHW (Degree Heating Weeks)**: Accumulated heat stress
  - 0-4: Normal to Watch
  - 4-8: Watch (bleaching possible)
  - 8-12: Warning (bleaching likely)
  - 12+: Alert Level 2 (severe bleaching expected)
- **SST (Sea Surface Temperature)**: Current water temperature
- **Alert Levels**: Color-coded warnings based on DHW

**What you can control**:
- ✅ Local stressors (pollution, fishing pressure, physical damage)
- ✅ Monitoring intensity and data collection
- ✅ Community awareness and engagement
- ✅ Documentation for future learning
- ❌ Ocean temperature (but you can prepare for and respond to it)

---

## PHASE 1: PREPARATION (Before Bleaching Event)

**When**: DHW 0, normal conditions, no alerts

### 1.1 Establish Baseline Monitoring
**Goal**: Know what "normal" looks like for your reef

Actions:
- Conduct monthly Aqualink surveys
- Document coral cover and species composition
- Take reference photos at consistent locations
- Record typical temperature patterns from dashboard
- Upload all baseline data to Aqualink

**Why it matters**: You can't detect change without knowing the baseline.

### 1.2 Build Response Capacity
**Goal**: Be ready when heat stress occurs

Actions:
- Identify 3-5 trained survey team members
- Create emergency contact list (team, authorities, scientists)
- Bookmark Aqualink dashboard and set up notifications
- Plan survey routes for different weather scenarios
- Prepare survey equipment (slates, cameras, GPS)

**Resources needed**: 
- Basic dive gear for team
- Underwater camera (smartphone in waterproof case works)
- GPS-enabled device
- Survey forms (can be printed or digital)

### 1.3 Map Vulnerable Areas
**Goal**: Know where to focus limited resources

Actions:
- Identify high-value coral areas
- Note areas with sensitive species (Acropora, Pocillopora tend to bleach first)
- Map areas with good water flow (may be more resilient)
- Document local stressors by location

**Strategic considerations**:
- Focus on areas that are manageable to monitor
- Balance ecological importance with accessibility
- Consider connectivity (larvae sources)

### 1.4 Reduce Existing Stressors
**Goal**: Give reefs best chance to withstand heat stress

Actions:
- Minimize anchor damage (install moorings if needed)
- Reduce pollution sources (sewage, agricultural runoff)
- Manage fishing pressure (consider seasonal restrictions)
- Prevent physical damage (educate tourists/fishers)
- Improve water quality where possible

**Remember**: Reefs facing multiple stressors are more vulnerable to bleaching.

### 1.5 Engage Community
**Goal**: Build awareness and support before crisis

Actions:
- Share Aqualink dashboard with stakeholders
- Explain DHW and alert levels to community
- Establish communication channels (WhatsApp group, etc.)
- Train volunteers in basic survey methods
- Create bleaching response plan with local authorities

**Key messages**:
- Bleaching is natural response to heat, not pollution (though pollution makes it worse)
- Early detection and action can make a difference
- Community observations are valuable data

---

## PHASE 2: EARLY WARNING (DHW 1, Watch Level)

**When**: Aqualink shows yellow "Watch" alert, DHW climbing toward 8

### 2.1 Increase Monitoring
**Frequency**: Check Aqualink daily, conduct weekly visual surveys

Actions:
- Review Heat Stress Analysis graph daily
- Watch for DHW trending upward
- Note SST vs historical maximum
- Begin weekly reef surveys
- Check Smart Buoy data if available (more accurate than satellite)

**What to look for**:
- Is DHW accelerating or plateauing?
- Is SST higher than normal for this time of year?
- Are there any signs of coral stress yet?

### 2.2 Document Early Signs
**Goal**: Catch bleaching at first appearance

Survey focus:
- Look for subtle color changes (paling)
- Note which species show stress first
- Photograph reference points
- Record any changes in coral behavior (polyp retraction)

**Species to watch** (typically bleach first):
- Acropora (staghorn, table corals)
- Pocillopora (cauliflower coral)
- Montipora (plating/encrusting corals)

More resistant species:
- Porites (massive/boulder corals)
- Favia (brain corals)
- Some soft corals

### 2.3 Prepare for Escalation
**Goal**: Be ready if DHW continues climbing

Actions:
- Alert team to potential for intensive monitoring
- Check survey equipment and supplies
- Prepare communication templates for stakeholders
- Review bleaching response protocols
- Consider pre-emptive local stressor reduction

**Planning questions**:
- Can we increase survey frequency to every 3-5 days?
- Do we have enough trained observers?
- Are authorities aware and supportive?
- What resources can we access if needed?

### 2.4 Communicate Status
**Goal**: Keep stakeholders informed early

Actions:
- Send "heads up" message to community
- Share Aqualink dashboard showing rising DHW
- Explain what Watch level means
- Outline potential next steps
- Request additional observers if needed

**Tone**: Informed, not alarming. This is preparation, not crisis.

## PHASE 3: ACTIVE BLEACHING (DHW 2, Warning Level)

**When**: Aqualink shows orange "Warning" alert, bleaching likely occurring

### 3.1 Intensive Monitoring
**Frequency**: Surveys every 3-5 days, check dashboard daily

Actions:
- Conduct systematic surveys of all monitored areas
- Document bleaching extent (% of corals affected)
- Record severity (pale/partially bleached/fully bleached)
- Track which species are most affected
- Upload photos and observations to Aqualink immediately

**Survey priorities**:
- Cover all reference points consistently
- Take wide shots (extent) and close-ups (severity)
- Note any spatial patterns (depth, exposure, flow)
- Document both bleached and resistant corals

### 3.2 Maximize Data Collection
**Goal**: Capture progression of event for learning

What to document:
- **Extent by area**: % of corals in each survey zone
- **Severity categories**:
  - Pale (0-30% color loss)
  - Partial (30-70% white)
  - Full (70-100% white)
  - Recently dead (algae film on skeleton)
- **Species responses**: Which resist? Which bleach first?
- **Environmental notes**: Storms, runoff, unusual conditions
- **Recovery signs**: Any recolonization of zooxanthellae?

**Data management**:
- Upload to Aqualink after every survey
- Organize photos by date and location
- Keep field notes backed up
- Share data with marine managers and scientists

### 3.3 Implement Mitigation
**Goal**: Remove all controllable stressors

Immediate actions:
- **Reduce physical damage**: Close high-traffic areas if possible
- **Minimize fishing pressure**: Implement temporary restrictions
- **Stop pollution sources**: Halt construction, fix sewage issues
- **Prevent compounding stress**: No coral cleaning, research activities
- **Engage enforcement**: Work with authorities on compliance

**What NOT to do**:
- ❌ Touch or move corals
- ❌ Apply treatments (shading, nutrients) without expert guidance
- ❌ Conduct extractive research during crisis
- ❌ Allow tourists to touch stressed corals

### 3.4 Community Mobilization
**Goal**: Maximize protective actions through collective effort

Actions:
- Daily or every-other-day updates to stakeholders
- Recruit additional observers for survey support
- Organize beach/reef cleanups (reduce local stress)
- Engage media for awareness (not panic)
- Coordinate with authorities on emergency measures

**Key messages**:
- "Our reef is under heat stress, but we're monitoring closely"
- "Every reduction in local stress helps"
- "Your observations and support matter"
- "We're documenting everything to learn and improve"

### 3.5 Strategic Planning
**Goal**: Prepare for recovery phase or further escalation

Planning questions:
- If bleaching progresses, what are our priorities?
- Which areas are most critical to protect?
- What resources can we mobilize?
- Who are our key contacts for emergency support?
- What data will be most valuable for future management?

**Emotional management**:
This is devastating to witness. Remember:
- You're doing everything possible
- Documentation helps prevent future events
- Some corals WILL survive
- Reefs can recover, especially with reduced local stress

### 4.2 Mortality Assessment
**Goal**: Understand what's lost and what survives

What to document:
- **Mortality by species**: Which died? Which survived?
- **Spatial patterns**: Did some areas fare better?
- **Individual resilience**: Mark locations of surviving colonies
- **Partial mortality**: Many corals partially die but can recover
- **Algae succession**: When does algae colonize dead skeleton?

**Data value**: This information is critical for:
- Identifying resilient genotypes for future restoration
- Understanding what conditions promoted survival
- Planning recovery strategies
- Contributing to global resilience research

### 4.3 Coordinate Response
**Goal**: Maximize regional/national support

Actions:
- Report to regional bleaching alert networks (if available)

## PHASE 5: RECOVERY & LEARNING (After Stress Subsides)

**When**: DHW drops below 4, temperatures return to normal

### 5.1 Assess Final Impact
**Goal**: Understand what happened and why

Comprehensive assessment:
- Final mortality rates by species and location
- Which areas recovered best? Why?
- Characteristics of resilient colonies
- Comparison to pre-event baseline
- Upload complete post-event survey to Aqualink

**Survey timing**:
- 2-4 weeks after stress ends: Initial assessment
- 3 months: Recovery progression
- 6 months: Established recovery patterns
- 12 months: Long-term outcomes

### 5.2 Track Recovery
**Goal**: Document resilience and inform restoration

Monthly monitoring focus:
- Recolonization of zooxanthellae (corals regaining color)
- Partial mortality patterns
- Algae overgrowth on dead areas
- New coral recruitment (babies!)
- Fish and invertebrate populations

**Positive signs**:
- Corals regaining color
- Minimal algae growth on recovering corals
- New coral polyps settling
- Fish populations stable or recovering
- Reduced disease outbreaks

**Warning signs**:
- Rapid algae overgrowth
- Secondary mortality from disease
- Low recruitment
- Persistent paling

### 5.3 Analyze and Learn
**Goal**: Extract maximum learning for future events

Key questions:
- What actions were most effective?

- Which areas proved most resilient? Why?
- Did local stressor reduction help?
- What data gaps did we have?

**Debrief activities**:
- Team meeting to review response
- Stakeholder gathering to share findings
- Document lessons learned
- Update response protocols
- Celebrate successes (even small ones)

### 5.4 Plan for Future
**Goal**: Build resilience for next event (and there will be one)

Strategic actions:
- **Prioritize resilient areas**: Focus protection on sites that fared best
- **Reduce ongoing stressors**: Double down on local management
- **Consider restoration**: Once stable, restoration may accelerate recovery
- **Strengthen monitoring**: Fill gaps identified during event
- **Build capacity**: Train more observers, improve equipment
- **Engage policy**: Use event data to advocate for climate action

**Restoration considerations** (only when appropriate):
- Wait until reef is stable (6-12 months post-bleaching)
- Focus on resilient genotypes
- Prioritize high-value areas with good conditions
- Ensure local stressors are managed
- Work with established restoration programs

### 5.5 Share Knowledge
**Goal**: Contribute to global understanding and support others

Actions:
- Write up event summary (Aqualink can help)
- Share at conferences or online forums
- Publish findings if appropriate
- Mentor other reef managers
- Contribute to scientific studies

**Your data is valuable**: Global resilience patterns emerge from local observations like yours. By sharing, you help reefs everywhere.
