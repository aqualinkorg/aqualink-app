                Current global ocean temperature monitoring systems are
                restricted to satellite-derived surface temperatures, which only
                capture the skin temperature of the water. The temperatures at
                greater depths, where coral sites can be found, are mostly
                unknown. Scientists will study those temperatures by installing
                local data loggers, which have to be physically retrieved from
                the site to have their data accessed. Once the loggers have been
                retrieved the findings will be published in a paper, but itâ€™s
                rare to get continuous real-time readings of those temperatures.
                The monitoring system we are deploying includes a solar-powered
                smart buoy that relays temperature information in real-time,
                giving us some of the needed data to detect coral bleaching
                events early and put response plans in place.

                The real-time temperature information is transmitted to our
                servers where a monitoring system combines that data with survey
                imagery to help understand the cause-and-effect of increasing
                temperatures on the local marine ecosystem. We are working with
                coral scientists to create easy-to-use instruction manuals for
                conducting site surveys and implementing response plans, all of
                which will be facilitated through our monitoring system.
