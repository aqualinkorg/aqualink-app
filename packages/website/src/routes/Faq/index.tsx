                    Shipping cost will vary greatly depending on your location.
                    To get an idea of shipping costs you can visit

                        Because our shipment will arrive in two boxes and using
                        our negotiated rates you will need to multiply this
                        result by 1.5x.&nbsp;

                    The total smart mooring system is small enough for regular

                    <br />
                    There is a ballast chain and smart mooring cable, the weight
                    and dimensions are still TBD but depending on the length of
                    cable needed for your target depth this should be around the
                    same dimensions and less than 15kg.

                  <p>
                    The smart mooring does not come with an anchor. It
                    terminates in a stainless steel shackle with a chain. This
                    can be attached to an existing mooring. We will work with
                    you to determine the best arrangement for mooring at your
                    site as factors like depth, wind, current, wave action, and
                    storms may determine the configuration of the mooring.
