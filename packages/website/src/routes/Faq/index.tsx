                  <p>
                    We collect temperature through satellite observations or
                    spotter (a Smart Buoy). Satellite measurements collect
                    temperature information from the very top layer of the
                    surface (skin temperature) based on a 5km grid. NOAA
                    publishes observed temperatures on a daily basis and makes
                    that available in their &quot;Daily Global 5km Satellite
                    Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring&quot;. Sofar Ocean
                    imports this data into their servers and Aqualink uses their
                    API to render the data in our web application. When a Smart
                    Buoy is deployed we collect temperature information every
                    hour from a depth of 1 meter as well as the moored depth
                    which is at the sea floor.

                  <p>
                    Heat stress is a measure of the amount of time above the 20
                    year historical maximum temperature. The unit of measure for
                    heat stress is degree heating weeks. Many marine
                    environments, like coral sites, degrade after prolonged heat
                    exposure which is why this is an important metric.

                    How can I best conduct surveys using Aqualink?
                  </Typography>
                  <p>
                    Aqualink allows you to conduct surveys in many different
                    ways depending on what your goal is with your monitoring
                    efforts. First, choose your survey site. Then select survey
                    points, which are multiple points within your survey site.
                    Depending on your methods, this can look different. Examples
                    of survey methods that work well in Aqualink are photo
                    quadrant in a transect, quadrant intercept in a transect,
                    point intersect (with quadrant or transect), or simply using
                    known locations within your survey site that you can
                    continuously monitor. For transects, each quadrant or point
                    will be a survey point. The entire transect will be the
                    survey site.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Add comments to the survey and each survey point. The
                    comments can include all the observations and data that you
                    have from that survey session. Write the details of the
                    corals that appeared based on your goals with your
                    monitoring efforts. For example, you can display if the
                    corals were healthy, bleached, or what percent of coral
                    cover they had. You can also add information such as Crown
                    of Thorns Starfish culled.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If your survey method is taking pictures of corals in known
                    locations, for example, we recommend that you take the image
                    from the exact same angles and distance. This provides the
                    best comparison between survey sessions. One good example of
                    this is:

                  <p>
                    The surveys will be lined up at the bottom of your dashboard
                    page in chronological order. Each survey includes all of the
                    survey points that you have added. When clicking on a survey
                    point, you&apos;ll see all the surveys conducted at that
                    survey point chronologically. This enables you to monitor a
                    single point in your reef over a longer period.

                    sonde or method. For the overall water quality data, we have
                    two types of dashboard cards, and they are named Sonde data
                    and HUI data on Aqualink. Sonde data includes dissolved
                    oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, acidity
                    (pH), salinity, and turbidity. You can use all of these five
                    parameters or just some of them when uploading data.

                    <br />
                    The HUI card includes turbidity, Nitrate Nitrite Nitrogen

                    The Smart Buoy does not come with an anchor. It terminates

                    attached to an existing mooring. We will work with you to
                    determine the best arrangement for mooring at your site as
                    factors like depth, wind, current, wave action, and storms
