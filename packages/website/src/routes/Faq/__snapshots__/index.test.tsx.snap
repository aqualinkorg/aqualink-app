                How are you measuring temperature?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                We collect temperature through satellite observations or spotter (a Smart Buoy). Satellite measurements collect temperature information from the very top layer of the surface (skin temperature) based on a 5km grid. NOAA publishes observed temperatures on a daily basis and makes that available in their "Daily Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring". Sofar Ocean imports this data into their servers and Aqualink uses their API to render the data in our web application. When a Smart Buoy is deployed we collect temperature information every hour from a depth of 1 meter as well as the moored depth which is at the sea floor.

                What is heat stress?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                Heat stress is a measure of the amount of time above the 20 year historical maximum temperature. The unit of measure for heat stress is degree heating weeks. Many marine environments, like coral sites, degrade after prolonged heat exposure which is why this is an important metric.

                Am I responsible for customs / duties / taxes?

              <p>
                Yes. As the recipient of the equipment you will need to determine if you need to pay these to receive your equipment at customs.

                How big is the Aqualink Smart Buoy?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The total Smart Buoy system is small enough for regular shipping such as UPS, DHL, FedEx, etc. The dimensions and weight of the buoy are:
                <br />
                <br />
                42cm diameter
                <br />
                31cm height
                <br />
                5.4 KG
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a ballast chain and smart mooring cable, the weight and dimensions are still TBD but depending on the length of cable needed for your target depth this should be around the same dimensions and less than 15kg.

                How is the Smart Buoy moored? Does it come with a mooring anchor?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The Smart Buoy does not come with an anchor. It terminates in a stainless steel shackle with a chain. This can be attached to an existing mooring. We will work with you to determine the best arrangement for mooring at your site as factors like depth, wind, current, wave action, and storms may determine the configuration of the mooring.

                Yes. You will need to know the regulations for your installation site and ensure you have the proper permits and permissions.
