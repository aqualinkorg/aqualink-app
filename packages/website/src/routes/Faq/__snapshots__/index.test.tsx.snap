                How are you measuring temperature?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                We collect temperature through satellite observations or spotter (a Smart Buoy). Satellite measurements collect temperature information from the very top layer of the surface (skin temperature) based on a 5km grid. NOAA publishes observed temperatures on a daily basis and makes that available in their "Daily Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring". Sofar Ocean imports this data into their servers and Aqualink uses their API to render the data in our web application. When a Smart Buoy is deployed we collect temperature information every hour from a depth of 1 meter as well as the moored depth which is at the sea floor.

                How do I connect my Sofar Spotter to Aqualink?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                You can easily connect your buoy by going to EDIT SITE DETAILS on your Aqualink dashboard. Click on Add custom API token and add the Spotter ID and the API. Then Click on Status and select deployed. Then press save. You can visit your Sofar Ocean account at&nbsp;

                What is heat stress?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                Heat stress is a measure of the amount of time above the 20 year historical maximum temperature. The unit of measure for heat stress is degree heating weeks. Many marine environments, like coral sites, degrade after prolonged heat exposure which is why this is an important metric.

                How can I best conduct surveys using Aqualink?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                Aqualink allows you to conduct surveys in many different ways depending on what your goal is with your monitoring efforts. First, choose your survey site. Then select survey points, which are multiple points within your survey site. Depending on your methods, this can look different. Examples of survey methods that work well in Aqualink are photo quadrant in a transect, quadrant intercept in a transect, point intersect (with quadrant or transect), or simply using known locations within your survey site that you can continuously monitor. For transects, each quadrant or point will be a survey point. The entire transect will be the survey site.
                <br />
                <br />
                Add comments to the survey and each survey point. The comments can include all the observations and data that you have from that survey session. Write the details of the corals that appeared based on your goals with your monitoring efforts. For example, you can display if the corals were healthy, bleached, or what percent of coral cover they had. You can also add information such as Crown of Thorns Starfish culled.
                <br />
                <br />
                If your survey method is taking pictures of corals in known locations, for example, we recommend that you take the image from the exact same angles and distance. This provides the best comparison between survey sessions. One good example of this is:

                How are the surveys structured?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The surveys will be lined up at the bottom of your dashboard page in chronological order. Each survey includes all of the survey points that you have added. When clicking on a survey point, you'll see all the surveys conducted at that survey point chronologically. This enables you to monitor a single point in your reef over a longer period.

                What water quality data can I upload?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                We allow HOBO data (HOBO data loggers), meteorological data, and overall water quality data that can be gathered by any sonde or method. For the overall water quality data, we have two types of dashboard cards, and they are named Sonde data and HUI data on Aqualink. Sonde data includes dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, acidity (pH), salinity, and turbidity. You can use all of these five parameters or just some of them when uploading data.
                <br />
                <br />
                The HUI card includes turbidity, Nitrate Nitrite Nitrogen (NNN), pH, and Salinity. This card will display watch, warning, and alert levels once you have determined what those levels are. Please let us know what the levels are, and we'll help you display your data.

                How can I upload temperature data to Aqualink?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                When uploading temperature data to Aqualink, please use the "HOBO data" sensor type. If you are using a HOBO temperature logger, you can upload the raw data file. If you're using any other type of temperature logger, add a column for time and date and another column for temperature. Please use this

                Yes, we cover the costs for the buoys, but you'll be responsible for shipping and customs fees. We're searching for people who can manage the buoys, perform surveys, and use the data for research and monitoring programs.

              <p>
                The total Smart Buoy system is small enough for regular shipping such as UPS, DHL, FedEx, etc. The dimensions and weight of the buoy are:
                <br />
                <br />
                42cm diameter
                <br />
                31cm height
                <br />
                5.4 KG
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a ballast chain and smart mooring cable, the weight and dimensions are still TBD but depending on the length of cable needed for your target depth this should be around the same dimensions and less than 15kg.

                How is the Smart Buoy moored? Does it come with a mooring anchor?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The Smart Buoy does not come with an anchor. It terminates in a stainless steel shackle with a chain. This can be attached to an existing mooring. We will work with you to determine the best arrangement for mooring at your site as factors like depth, wind, current, wave action, and storms may determine the configuration of the mooring.
