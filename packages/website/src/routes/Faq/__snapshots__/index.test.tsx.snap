                What are the shipping costs?

              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                Shipping cost will vary greatly depending on your location. To get an idea of shipping costs you can visit https://onlineshippingcalculator.com/ and enter the following:
                <br />

                <li>

                <li>

                    Weight will be 22lbs

                <li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Because our shipment will arrive in two boxes and using our negotiated rates you will need to multiply this result by 1.5x. 
                    <br />
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    This should be a rough estimate.

                Am I responsible for customs / duties / taxes?

                Yes. As the recipient of the equipment you will need to determine if you need to pay these to receive your equipment at customs.

                How big is the smart mooring and spotter buoy?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The total smart mooring system is small enough for regular shipping such as UPS, DHL, FedEx, etc. The dimensions and weight of the buoy are:
                <br />
                <br />
                42cm diameter
                <br />
                31cm height
                <br />
                5.4 KG
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a ballast chain and smart mooring cable, the weight and dimensions are still TBD but depending on the length of cable needed for your target depth this should be around the same dimensions and less than 15kg.
                <br />

                How is the smart mooring moored? Does it come with a mooring anchor?
              </mock-typography>
              <p>
                The smart mooring does not come with an anchor. It terminates in a stainless steel shackle with a chain. This can be attached to an existing mooring. We will work with you to determine the best arrangement for mooring at your site as factors like depth, wind, current, wave action, and storms may determine the configuration of the mooring.

                Yes. You will need to know the regulations for your installation site and ensure you have the proper permits and permissions.
