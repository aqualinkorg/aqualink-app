      "There is some incredible existing technology that uses satellites to measure the oceanâ€™s surface temperature from space. However, coral reefs and other important marine ecosystems are not always near the surface, and complex ocean dynamics can create a large temperature difference just a few meters down. To augment the satellite temperature, we partnered with Sofar Ocean to design a buoy that measures the temperature at the ocean floor. By building as many of these buoys as we can, and deploying them around the world, we can begin to build a dataset that helps in understanding where and when heat stress in the ocean will occur. By measuring, we can understand. And by understanding, we can begin to help.",

    text:
      "Each site on the Aqualink web app has a detailed page outlining the satellite data, buoy data, heat stress alert level, as well as weather and a time history of the temperature. But perhaps most importantly for the site manager, it provides the ability to upload survey imagery and correlate it with all the other data. When a user uploads imagery, it provides a snapshot in time of the measured temperature with visual observations. By tagging the images, we are beginning to create a structured database that future machine learning algorithms can use to help predict heat stress events, such as coral bleaching. Adding surveys also connects the local ecosystem manager to a global network of scientists and engineers that are working everyday to protect these sensitive environments. The datasets are free and available to everyone.",
