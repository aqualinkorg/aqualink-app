      "There is some incredible existing technology that uses satellites to measure the oceanâ€™s surface temperature from space. However, coral reefs and other important marine ecosystems are not always near the surface, and complex ocean dynamics can create a large temperature difference just a few meters down. To augment the satellite temperature, we partnered with Sofar Ocean to design a buoy that measures the temperature at the ocean floor. By building as many of these buoys as we can, and deploying them around the world, we can begin to build a dataset that helps in understanding where and when heat stress in the ocean will occur. By measuring, we can understand. And by understanding, we can begin to help.",
