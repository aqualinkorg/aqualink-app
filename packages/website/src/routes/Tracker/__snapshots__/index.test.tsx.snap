          A large part of the Brazilian coastline is currently experiencing an extreme heatwave, which has as bleached up to 100% of the corals in some reefs. The heatwave has brought consistent temperatures above the bleaching threshold since February 2024, which is a very long time for corals. Temperature increases above the bleaching threshold for corals can result in bleaching, which will eventually kill the coral completely.

The second survey, conducted on March 26th in the middle of the heatwave, shows bleached corals. The final survey, conducted on May 25th, just after the heatwave, shows dead corals.

          The ability for sensors to be grouped for a particular event, such as a Heatwave, or a particular region, is important for users to get critical information at a glance. We have launched a new feature called Dashboards where anyone can create a customized collection of sensors to track this information. For example, the

          that aggregrates all the sensors involved in tracking this event to get a real-time view of the severity. Scientists, media, and the general public can use this feature to get a holistic view of regional and event-based information, and we hope to enable a better understanding of how to protect the ecosystems during such times as the La Nina Heatwave.

          To get started, head over to one of the sites you are interested in adding to your Dashboard. A bookmark icon will appear next to the site name in the heading. Clicking this will add the site. To remove it, simply click the bookmark icon again. Your dashboard page will aggregate all the sites that you add this way, and the name of the collection can be customized to reflect the region, event, or other interest.
