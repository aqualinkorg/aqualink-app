          The ability for sensors to be grouped for a particular event, such as a Heatwave, or a particular region, is important for users to get critical information at a glance. We have launched a new feature called Dashboards where anyone can create a customized collection of sensors to track this information. For example, the

          that aggregrates all the sensors involved in tracking this event to get a real-time view of the severity. Scientists, media, and the general public can use this feature to get a holistic view of regional and event-based information, and we hope to enable a better understanding of how to protect the ecosystems during such times as the La Nina Heatwave.

          To get started, head over to one of the sites you are interested in adding to your Dashboard. A bookmark icon will appear next to the site name in the heading. Clicking this will add the site. To remove it, simply click the bookmark icon again. Your dashboard page will aggregate all the sites that you add this way, and the name of the collection can be customized to reflect the region, event, or other interest.

            We worked closely with the Minderoo Foundation to build this feature. The funding for the Heatwave Tracker development was provided by the FootPrint Coalition and we would like to thank them for their support.
